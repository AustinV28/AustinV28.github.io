## Effort Estimation and Tracking: Lessons Learned

### I. Introduction

Effort estimation and tracking has played a pivotal role in project management, as it provided insights into resource allocation, progress monitoring, and risk mitigation. Despite the inherent challenges and uncertainties associated with estimation, these practices served as a valuable tool for optimizing project planning and execution. After taking a look at my estimations, I have learned quite a lot about how I managed my time and what I need to change or fix for future assignments and projects.

### II. Making Effort Estimates

Effort estimates serve as initial benchmarks for planning and prioritizing project tasks. While my estimates often deviated from actual outcomes, the process of estimation encouraged me to have critical thinking. By breaking down complex issues into manageable components and assigning tentative timeframes, I gained a clearer and better understanding of what I needed to do next.

### III. Benefits of Effort Estimates

Despite the inherent inaccuracies of effort estimates, several benefits emerged from the estimation process. Firstly, estimates allowed for better communication and alignment among my team members, facilitating collaborative decision-making and resource allocation. Secondly, estimates provided a basis for identifying potential risks and dependencies early in the project lifecycle, enabling proactive mitigation strategies. Lastly, the act of estimating encouraged accountability and ownership, motivating me and my team members to strive for realistic and achievable goals.

### IV. Tracking Actual Effort

Tracking actual effort expended on project tasks offers valuable insights into progress and performance. While my initial reluctance to track effort stemmed from concerns about overhead and micromanagement, I soon recognized the benefits of data-driven decision-making. By comparing estimated versus actual effort, I gained a deeper understanding of task complexity and resource utilization, informing future estimation practices and project planning.

### V. Benefits of Tracking Actual Effort

Tracking actual effort allowed for several benefits for project management and performance evaluation. Firstly, it provides visibility into productivity trends, while enabling timely interventions to mitigate project delays or resource constraints. Secondly, it facilitated much more accurate forecasting and resource allocation, all while ensuring optimal utilization of team resources and budgetary allocations. Lastly, it allowed me to have continuous improvement, it encouraged me to reflect and adapt based on the data and insights.

### VI. Tracking

To track actual effort, I used a stopwatch. While my approach had its advantages and limitations, I prioritized consistency and accuracy in data capture. Despite occasional challenges in capturing nuanced aspects of effort, such as cognitive load and context switching, I believe my tracking efforts were reasonably accurate and reflective of overall project dynamics.

### VII. Conclusion

In conclusion, while effort estimation and tracking may not yield perfect predictions or outcomes, their value lies in their ability to provide structure, visibility, and accountability in project management. By embracing estimation as a tool for informed decision-making and tracking as a means of continuous improvement, it allowed for my project and my team to find issues easier, and it allowed us to communicate better as a team, It also navigated uncertainties and challenges more effectively, and allowed for us to deliver a successful outcome.
