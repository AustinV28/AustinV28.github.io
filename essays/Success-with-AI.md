## How AI helped me push through Software Engineering

### I. Introduction

As a student navigating the complexities of software engineering in ICS 314, I have found artificial intelligence (AI) to be such a great learning tool. At the start of the semester, I was having quite a rough time with just the thought of the future assignments and projects we had to do in the class. I always thought to myself that I would never be able to succeed in ICS 314 with atleast a decent grade, but that is when I found out later on during class that we would be able to use AI. At first I have been speeding through assignments without properly using AI to my advantage, to be honest I was just copy and pasting code at the first couple of week of class. But as soon as we had our very first WOD which is a timed assessment, I failed it miserably. Then I thought to myself, what did I do wrong, what can I do to succeed on future WODs, and then thats when I realized that AI is not just something to do your work for you but rather a learning tool to help you learn and grow with it's usage. I never really thought about it in that way so I asked it questions all night and it surprisingly answered all of my questions quickly and most importantly, correctly. Ever since then I used AI to help me understand material that I was confused with, how I can fix certain codes and my errors, I asked it for everything you could imagine. But the most important thing to me is the way I learned how to use it to my own learning advantage. Without it, the challenges of debugging, coding, and understanding complex concepts would have been daunting. AI, far from being a mere "cheat code," has been instrumental in my success in this class. By leveraging AI to learn, ask questions, and seek assistance, I have been able to improve significantly and tackle the course requirements with confidence.

   ### II. Personal Experience with AI:

1. **Experience WODs:** AI played a crucial role in helping me debug code and complete coding tasks during Workshops of the Day (WODs). I always used AI for my WODs whether if it was a small error I needed help with or if I needed some tips of what to do for the specific WOD. AI provided invaluable support in overcoming challenges efficiently. Without it, I probably wouldn't be where I am at right now and with the knowledge I have, AI helped me through a lot.

2. **In-class Practice WODs:** In-class Practice WODs allowed me to find new opportunities to leverage AI for rapid code generation and debugging. While AI tools facilitated quick problem-solving, I also recognized the importance of independent experimentation and learning how to format things properly to my advantage.

3. **In-class WODs:** Similar to Practice WODs, AI played a pivotal role in aiding me during In-class WODs. By providing real-time feedback and suggestions, AI enhanced my coding experience and fostered a collaborative learning environment. Without it, I would have not had enough time to finish most of the WODs on my own due to the fact that I make a bunch of mistakes in my code whether it be small or big.

4. **Essays:** Although AI was not directly utilized for essay writing, I explored its potential applications in generating structured outlines and refining content organization. However, I prioritized independent research and critical thinking in crafting my essays.

5. **Final project:** For the final project, AI served as a valuable resource for brainstorming ideas and optimizing code implementation. AI-driven tools facilitated project management tasks and enabled efficient collaboration with team members. I was able to get things done the correct way and much quicker, all while understanding and learning at the same time.

6. **Learning a concept / tutorial:** When encountering challenging concepts or tutorials, I turned to AI for supplementary explanations and clarification. AI algorithms provided great insights and enriched my understanding of complex topics.

7. **Answering a question in class or in Discord:** In both classroom discussions and online forums like Discord, I did not use AI.

8. **Asking or answering a smart-question:** AI technologies empowered me to ask intelligent questions and receive targeted responses. By leveraging AI-driven search engines and forums, I accessed relevant resources and expanded my knowledge base. Even if I knew what I wanted to say, I did not know how to properly ask a question in a SMART way so that is when I described my thoughts and question to AI and it provided me a simple and short smart question.

9. **Coding example e.g. “give an example of using an array”:** I remember in one of our early WODs we had to use an array and I did not really understand how to properly use it and I ended up not completing the WOD on time. I turned to AI for guidance on syntax and implementation strategies. AI algorithms generated illustrative code snippets demonstrating array initialization, manipulation, and iteration. By analyzing AI-generated examples, I gained practical insights into leveraging arrays effectively in software development.

10. **Explaining Code Concepts:** When encountering unfamiliar code constructs or algorithms, I turned to AI for explanations and clarifications. Through interactive dialogue and query-based learning, AI was able to explain complex concepts and facilitated deeper understanding.

11. **Writing code:** Throughout coding assignments and projects, AI and code editors enhanced my coding experience and productivity. AI algorithms suggested code completions and offered real-time error detection, improving code quality and efficiency.

12. **Documenting code:** AI-driven documentation tools streamlines the process of documenting code and generating project documentation. However I have not used AI to document code.

13. **Quality assurance:** Whenever I had a code that I had a hard time fixing or a WOD that I did not complete on time, I would use AI as code review sessions and quality assurance checks, AI-powered analysis tools identified my errors and performance. AI helped me learn from my mistakes and allowed me to do better on the next upcoming issues.

14. **Other uses in ICS 314 not listed:** AI has been a useful tool for me for other uses in ICS 314 such as data analysis, project planning, and collaborative decision-making. AI technologies augmented my learning journey and enriched my overall educational experience.

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:

The integration of AI into my learning journey has been transformative. AI served as a personalized tutor, guiding me through complex software engineering concepts with tailored explanations and insights. By adapting to my learning pace and preferences, AI enabled me to grasp abstract principles and apply them effectively in practical scenarios.

### IV. Practical Applications:

Throughout ICS 314, AI proved to be an invaluable asset in real-world applications. From optimizing code structure to automating quality assurance processes, AI technologies streamlined software development workflows and enhanced productivity. By harnessing AI-powered tools and platforms, I was able to accelerate project timelines and deliver high-quality software solutions especially during rough times when I would be stuck doing a certain task, AI helped me push through all of those rough times and I was able to learn from it and understand what I did wrong or how to do a specific thing.

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:

Despite its numerous benefits, the integration of AI also presented challenges and ethical considerations. As AI technologies continue to evolve, it is crucial to understand that if your just using AI to help you finish your work quicker or do your work for you, you won't learn much by doing so. To me, it honestly depends on how you use AI, and the biggest challenge to me is honestly just being able to use it as a learning tool rather than taking advantage of it. By being able to use AI efficiently and effectively, we can learn and grow together all while maximizing its transformative potential in software engineering education.

### VI. Comparative Analysis:

In comparing traditional teaching methods with AI-enhanced approaches, I observed significant advantages in terms of personalized learning experiences and adaptive feedback mechanisms. AI not only augmented traditional practices but also fostered a dynamic and interactive learning environment. Moving forward, the integration of AI and human expertise holds promise for advancing software engineering education and nurturing future innovators in the field.

### VII. Future Considerations:

Looking ahead, the future role of AI in software engineering education is full with possibilities. By embracing emerging technologies, we can unlock new pathways for collaborative learning, research, and industry partnerships. As AI continues to revolutionize the educational landscape, I am eager to contribute to its evolution and shape the future of software engineering education.

### VIII. Conclusion:

Reflecting on my journey through ICS 314, it's undeniable that AI has been a game-changer in my learning experience. From assisting with coding tasks to providing invaluable insights into complex concepts, AI has served as a trusted companion and mentor throughout the course. Without AI, navigating the intricacies of software engineering would have been significantly more challenging, if not impossible. As I look back on the ways in which AI has enriched my learning journey, I am filled with gratitude for the opportunities it has afforded me.
