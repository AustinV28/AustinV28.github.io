Growing up I was always fascinated by complex mechanisms, solving problems, and creating nothing into something. I was always eager to build things as a child, I remembered that I would create these lego candy machines, lego weapons with loading and firing mechanisms, you name it, I built it all no matter how difficult the task was or how long it took. As time went on, I grew older and grew out of it, but I always knew that I had a passion for doing things like that, that's when I discovered programming from my relatives who are successful software developers and IT specialists. It brought me to a whole new world of imagination like no other, I was excited for it, I was ready to start a new path into my life but as my first couple of years went by, it seemed like what started as a new passion turned out to be a hoax, but that changed drastically.

Throughout the first couple of years into college, I was really just going on with whatever was assigned to me, it wasn't like I actually disliked my major and programming, it just felt different and I didnt feel like I would ever be able to have fun and feel passionate about the things that I am doing. I knew that I wanted to work at a gaming industry but I did not know exactly what to do or what I wanted to do. As time went on I found myself in a deep hole, I did know how to program and code but I was unable to do it without the help of online tools such as AI. I felt discouraged and had little to no confidence in my own ability to create nothing into something from coding in comparison to building lego contraptions off the back of my head as a kid. But that all changed the very moment I stepped into the doors to this software engineering I class that I am currently taking.

At first, I was quite nervous taking the class because I just thought that it would be the same as my past classes where I am given a task and to just write a code that fits the descriptions requirements but I was all wrong. I came into the class having little to no knowledge about javascript off the back of my head, I did not feel like doing anything at all and was just going to use AI to help me get a passing grade in the class, but as soon as I walked into the classroom I felt a really intense amount of energy inside that classroom and in my head I was just thinking oh my goodness, I was amazed at everything, the students looked all confident and motivated, the professor loved to teach, and the environment itself just made me feel like I belong here.

My initial thoughts and my passion and dedication into computer science changed the very first week of taking this software engineering I class. What started it all was when we were given an assignment about our SMART goals, on the goals I talked about myself and what I wanted to do and wanted to achieve, I wrote about how I have little to no confidence in my own skills and that I am unable to create nothing into something through coding, I also wrote about what I wanted to accomplish and to just be able to grow and mature as a person who is majoring in computer science. After the SMART goal assignment, we were given another assignment which was to view these javascript basics lessons and do each task, there was around 120 different tasks to complete and honestly when I first saw it I just felt like using AI to help me speed through the entire thing so I can get it over with, but thats where the SMART goals came into my head while I was thinking about what I should do, I remembered my goal and what I wanted to change about myself, so I took up the courage to just do a little bit of the problems, and that little bit turned into more, and that more turned into me doing the entire thing in one sitting without needing the use of any sort of AI unless I really needed it. I felt happy afterwards, I felt like this is it, this is what I have always been looking for. As a few days has past since that javascript basics assignment, I actually started enjoying writing code and felt more passionate and confident in my own work. We were given these tasks called WODS which were timed and we would have to read a short description and generate a code and finish it in the time given. At first I didn't like it and felt like I was unable to do it myself but after doing a few practice WODS on my own before class, I saw myself actually enjoying it dedicating my time into learning what mistakes I made or what I had to do. I truly had a fun time learning about my mistakes and what I needed to do to fix it whether it be punctuation errors, capitalization errors, or if the entire code was not working at all I would redo them on my own time and keep on redoing it until I nailed it while understanding every little aspect of the code. 

In conclusion, after just one week of taking software engineering I, the class marked a new beginning for me. With each task, I found joy in creating things with code, and even timed challenges like WODs became less challenging for me. All I can say is that it's is never too late to start, you never know what will happen unless you really try.
