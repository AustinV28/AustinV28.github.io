This was an assignment I had for my ICS 212.

The code showcases the implementation of complex number operations in C, and through this assignment, I gained hands-on experience in working with complex numbers and learned valuable concepts in C programming.

In this assignment, I learned how to:
- Define and use structures in C.
- Perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers.
- Use C programming constructs for control flow and decision-making.

Here is the code:
