Monster Fighters is a simple RPG text game that I created in the summer of 2023. 

The game initializes variables for player health, player attack power, and player gold. Also, for each encounter a random monster is selected, and both the player and monster health are initialized with random values. The player can either choose to attack or run from the monster and if the player chooses to attack, random damage is calculated for the player and the monster, and their health is adjusted accordingly. If the player decides to run, the encounter with the monster ends and is moved onto the next monster. The game plays until the player's health drops to 0, and the final output displays if the player had won or lost, along with the total amount of gold earned

In this project I gained more hands on experience with coding in Java. I learned more about Java and how I could use my skills to hopefully develop or help develop a big game in the future.
Here is the code for the game:
